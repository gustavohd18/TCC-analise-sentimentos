# Sentiment analysis using Twitter

This repository is a fork of a conclusion project called TCC at brazil by student Thiago medina from the Computer Science course at PUCRS. The main idea is to extend your proposed work by adding new tweets with classification, and balancing the data in order to have a more accurate model for your use in a future project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.0 64-bit version
- pip (in Python 3.4 or superior, pip is already built-in)
